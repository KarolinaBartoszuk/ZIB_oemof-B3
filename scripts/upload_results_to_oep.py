Description
-------------
Uploads results data in oemof_b3-format to the OpenEnergyPlatform (OEP).

The oemetadata format is a standardised json file format and required for all data uploaded to
the OEP. It includes the data model and the used data types. This allows us to derive the
necessary tables in sqlalchemy from it.
